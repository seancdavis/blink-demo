- [✔︎] Add admin seed function that will create users and posts. It should be able to accept a series of posts that I've gotten from ChatGPT.
- [ ] Need to be signed in to post, but not to view home page or individual posts.
- [ ] Show truncated posts on the home page.
- [ ] Get durable cache working for post detail and profiles.
- [ ] Add branding, favicon, and logo.
- [ ] Clean up styles
- [ ] Better default avatar images for seeded content (or generate them)
- [ ] Feedback appears when reloading the login and register pages sometimes. I think there is a route that shouldn't be running the auth middleware. Perhaps we should specify the individual routes.
